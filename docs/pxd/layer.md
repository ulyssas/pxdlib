# Pixelmator Pro (.pxd) format: Layers

The layer object is exposed in three [tables](/docs/pxd/#sql). `document_layers` contains two identifiers:
- `id`, an integer, is used to link it to the `layer_tiles` and `layer_info` tables;
- `identifier`, an UUID string, is used to link the document to other layers.

The `document_layers.type` is an integer indicating the layer's type. It is one of:

1. A raster layer. Only these layers will have a corresponding `layer_tiles` table; if a non-empty layer, the layerâ€™s contents are stored in the data folder.
2. A text layer.
3. A vector layer.
4. A group layer, containing other layers.

It's not too hard to construct a tree of layers with `parent_identifier` and `index_at_parent`; `parent_identifier` is null for top-level layers. However, take note that any layer may have a single child in the form of a raster layer as a visibility mask. (See the `flags` attribute below for how to identify this.)

Below are a list of attributes which can be obtained from `layer_info`.

## Common attributes

Every layer will have the following attributes:

- `name` ([`Strn`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is the visual name of the layer;
- `opacity` (`LOpc`) is a big-endian (!) short integer from 0 to 100 giving the layer's opacity from 0 through 100;
- `flags` (`UI64`) is a 64-bit integer representing a bitmask. From the least significant bit:
  - The first bit defined if a layer is visible;
  - The second bit defines if a layer is locked;
  - The third bit is unknown;
  - The fourth bit defines if a layer is a clipping mask (i.e. will mask onto the layer below);
  - The fifth bit defines if a layer is a mask (i.e. defines the mask of its parent layer);
  - The sixth bit is unknown;
  - The seventh bit is on iff the layer is a raster;
- `color-value` is a raw integer (i.e. _not_ a blob) defining the color (aka tag) given to the layer: 0 if untagged, or 1-7 for various tags.
- `blendMode` (`Blnd`) are four characters (in reverse order) which define the blend mode. (See `BlendMode` under [`enums.py`](/pxdlib/enums.py) for a list of values.)
- `position` ([`PTPt`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) points to the center of the layer.
- `size` ([`PTSz`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is the size of the layer in pixels.
- `scale` ([`PTPt`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)), (unknown).
- `backingScale` ([`PTFl`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)), (unknown).
- `anchorPoint` ([`PTPt`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)), (unknown).
- `angle` ([`PTFl`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)), in degrees from -360 to 0. Nominally 0 except for text layers.
- `transform` (`Trns`), (unknown).
- `user-info-data`, a UTF-8 encoded PLIST file, nominally empty.

Optionally present are the [`styles-data`](/docs/pxd/styles.md#styles-data), [`color-adjustments`](/docs/pxd/styles.md#color-adjustments) and [`effects-data`](/docs/pxd/styles.md#effects-data) attributes (unknown).

## Raster layers

The properties of raster layers are unknown.

## Text layers

In addition to shared attributes, text layers share the following attributes:

- `text-version` ([`SI16`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is nominally one;
- `text-layerType` ([`SI16`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is either 0 (regular text) or 2 (path text). I haven't observed type 1 in the wild.
- `text-nameIsDynamic` ([`SI16`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is a boolean that tells Pixelmator whether to dynamically rename the layer according to the text contents. It defaults to one, and changes to zero whenever the label is changed manually (in Pixelmator or in `pxdlib` :)
- `text-verticalAlignment` ([`SI16`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is either 0 (top), 1 (middle) or 2 (bottom).
- `text-widthAutosizable` ([`SI16`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is another boolean, and it similarly defaults to one and changes to zero when the user has manually sized the textbox (so that text should wrap rather than keep going).
- `text-insets` ([`PTSz`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) is the horizontal and vertical padding for wrapping. It is nominally `[4.0, 4.0]` for regular text and `[0.0, 0.0]` for path text.
- `text-stringData`, a vercon with one entry: `StringNSCodingData`, a base-64 encoded binary PLIST, in which most of the text data is stored. See [text.md](/docs/pxd/stringData.md) for more info.

For path text (`text-layerType` of 2), the following attributes are also found:

- All three of `text-layer{Start,Middle,End}PointOnPath` ([`PTPt`](/docs/pxd/#blobs)) are the locations of the anchors of the text, coordinates in pixels from the bottom left of the bounding box of the path.
- `text-pathData` is a vercon with one entry: `dataFromCGPath`, a base-64 encoded path object. (unknown)


## Vector layers

In addition to almost certainly containing a [`styles-data`](/docs/pxd/styles.md#styles-data) tag, vector layers contain one added `shape-shapeData`, a vercon containing the following tags:

- `identifier` and `content-identifier`, both UUIDs;
- `geometry` (unknown),
- `pathCodableWrappers`, a vercon (unknown)
