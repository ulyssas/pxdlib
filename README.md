# pxdlib (Alpha 0.0.1)

`pxdlib` is a library intended for deciphering and manipulating `.pxd` files,
used by the image editor [Pixelmator Pro].

Documentation exists for the [API], and a much longer set of documentation exists
for the [reverse-engineering] of the `.pxd` format. Neither are feature-complete yet.
